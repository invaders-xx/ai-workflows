*Clear steps for an LLM to fully complete the project, if necessary with intermediate validation steps for a human. If some steps cannot be performed by an LLM (e.g., actions to be performed in a terminal), delimit with <HUMAN>...</HUMAN> the step, and clearly mention that all steps delimited by <HUMAN>...</HUMAN> must be performed by a human, and how to do it.*
