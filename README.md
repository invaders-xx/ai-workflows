## üéØ The Challenge

We've all been there:
- AI interactions that work great... sometimes
- Prompts we keep rewriting from scratch
- Juggling between AI tools and interfaces
- No way to scale what works well

All while being stuck between consumer interfaces that feel like toys and expensive rigid proprietary solutions that lock us in.

## üí° Our Solution

A battle-tested approach that empowers anyone to do much more than with ChatGPT and similar tools - no expensive middlemen needed.

Here's how it works:

### 1. Generate Instructions That Work
- Describe a complex project in vague terms
- Use AI to generate detailed instructions to realize it
- Refine with AI until it satisfies your needs

### 2. Build Libraries of Workflows
- Package instructions into text-based workflows that anybody can run
- Organize workflows across your files (shared drives, code repositories, etc.)
- Improve your library alone or with your team

### 3. Automate Workflows That Need It
- Convert any text-based workflow into code that can run anywhere

#### The Benefits

For Individuals:
- Build complex reproducible workflows
- Control and adapt them to your specific needs
- Scale your AI interactions effectively

For Organizations:
- Empower collaborators beyond private chatbots
- Generate libraries of repeatable, traceable AI workflows
- Enable knowledge sharing between colleagues
- Seamlessly integrate with quality management systems

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Copy What You Need
```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _ai_workflows/           # Text-based workflows ready to use
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _ai_workflows_packages/  # Python framework for automation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _ai_workflows_tutorial/  # Step-by-step learning guides
```

Copy this into any project you want to augment with AI workflows:
```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Personal projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code repositories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shared drives
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Obsidian vaults
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Any structured content
```

### 2. Choose Your Path

#### Start With Instructions (Recommended)
1. Navigate to `_ai_workflows/factory/new_instructions/`
2. Copy the content of `run.md` into your AI assistant (e.g., Cursor AI Composer)
3. Modify with your project goals
4. Enter this as a prompt
5. Find your instructions in the `_generated/` folder
6. Enter these instructions into your AI assistant to see the power of structured instructions!
7. And of course, keep refining by discussing with AI!

#### Jump Into Workflows
1. Navigate to `_ai_workflows/factory/new_workflow/`
2. Follow the same steps as for new instructions

#### Dive Into Code
When you're ready for more power:
```bash
# Navigate to the framework folder
cd _ai_workflows_packages/ai_workflows

# Try an example
cd ../../_ai_workflows/code_based/faq_analysis/_code
python run.py
```

For detailed setup instructions (Python, API keys, etc.), see our [framework guide](_ai_workflows_packages/ai_workflows/README.md).
