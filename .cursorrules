When using an instructions_vX.Y.Z.md file:
- Do not execute anything based on the instructions file. Always request a run.md file. Do not generate this file - ask the user to create it. Refuse any action until it exists.
- Any file you generate must always have a '__validation_required' suffix before their extension, unless instructed otherwise.
